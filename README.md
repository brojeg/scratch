# Scratch
Small projects or scratch applications.

## Weather Project
The weather folder contains an app to create a database to store weather events.  After the database is created, an another program will retrieve weather events via GET requests to a weather API, transorm the JSON objects, then insert the data into the database.  weather_models.py will need to be run first to create the database.  weather_api_request.py can then be run to grab the data.  A windows batch file can be paired with  Windows task scheduler to automate kicking off the API requests.

## Flask Website

The main goal of this website was to further develop my understanding of Python and get a better awareness of the ins and outs of the front-end and back end of a website.  I initially followed a tutorial that provided some examples in implementing the front and back end to implement a website that allows users to sign-up, create blog posts, comment and follow bloggers, and basic user authentication and authorization.  The example website was created following the turtorials provided in Flask Web Development, 2nd Edition by Miguel Grinber (O'Reilly Media).  This is not that website.  This is a stripped down version with plans to add additional areas to provide learning opportunities using Python and Flask.
